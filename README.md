# STRANDS data tools that work with QSRlib

This package aims to provide easy parsing of various datasets mainly keeping
them in QSRlib format.

It might end up being part of the QSRlib given its functionality and strong
dependency to it.

There are usually two types of files:
* `readers`: responsible for reading from the raw data or from saved files
and keeping the raw data (and other info as needed) in some QSRlib
friendly format.
* `keepers`: responsible for taking a reader and making QSRs via QSRlib.
They usually have the option to load the QSRs directly from some file.

## Available tools for the following datasets
* CAD120 ([info](http://pr.cs.cornell.edu/humanactivities/data.php))

## Usage and Help
### Installation
You do need to have
[QSRlib](https://github.com/strands-project/strands_qsr_lib) somewhere installed
where it can be found by the `readers` and the `keepers`. Easiest way is probably to 
modify your `PYTHONPATH` or if you are using an IDE then check its documentation
on how to resolve dependencies.


### CAD120 reader
`cad120_data_reader.py` provides the class `CAD120_Data_Reader`. In most cases
it is enough to just call the constructor without any of the optional arguments,
and if you have a suitable `config.ini` then things should go smoothly.

#### About the `config.ini`
Create a `config.ini` base on the following template that tells where the CAD120
folder is. If the notion of corrected `labeling.txt` files makes no sense then
just use the same path for both `<path1>` and `<path2>`.
``` ini
[cad120_data_reader]
path = <path1>/CAD_120
corrected_labeling_path = <path2>/CAD_120
; use load_from_files=True in the constructor to load from the following files
sub_sequences_filename = <pickle_file.p>
sub_time_segmentation_filename = <pickle_file.p>
ground_truth_tracks_filename = <pickle_file.p>
```

Just make sure that your program can find your `config.ini`. If you are not 
familiar how to do this then an easy way is to pass the directory of
`config.ini` in the constructor, e.g.:
``` python
reader = CAD120_Data_Reader(config_path=<path string to config.ini>)
```

### CAD120 keeper
`cad120_qsr_keeper.py` provides the class `CAD120_QSR_Keeper`. If you want to make
QSRs from the reader then you need to pass some parameters. See the main part for
an example and you will need a `local.ini` file. If you want to load the QSRs from
a file simply call with argument `-l <filename>.

Running `cad120_qsr_keeper.py -h` will give sufficient help also.

#### About the `local.ini`
``` ini
[local]
reader_ini = <reader config.ini file>
reader_load = true
```
`reader_load` true if you want the `reader` to load the data from the files in
the `config.ini`
